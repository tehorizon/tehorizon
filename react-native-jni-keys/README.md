# react-native-jni-keys

secure keys through jni c++. **Note:** it is more secure than [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config "react-native-config")

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-jni-keys
```

## Basic Usage

Create a new file `.jnikeys.json` in the root of your React Native app and add keys in `secure` object like this:

```
{
  "secure":{
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2"
  }
}
```

Then access variables defined there from your app:

## React Native
```js
import JniKeys from 'react-native-jni-keys';

const value = await JniKeys.getKey('key1');  //value1
```

Keep in mind It's [basically impossible to prevent users from reverse engineering mobile app secrets](https://rammic.github.io/2015/07/28/hiding-secrets-in-android-apps/) but we can more secure key than [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config "react-native-config"), 

## Setup

Install the package:

```
$ yarn add react-native-jni-keys
```

Link the library:

(Note: For React Native 0.60 or greater, [autolinking](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#native-modules-are-now-autolinked) is available)

(Note: For Windows, this module supports autolinking when used with `react-native-windows@0.63`
or later. For earlier versions you need to manually link the module.)

```
$ react-native link react-native-jni-keys
```

if cocoapods are used in the project then pod has to be installed as well:

```
(cd ios; pod install)
```

 - Manual Link (iOS)

	1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add 		Files to [your project's name]`
	2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-jni-keys` and add 		`JniKeys.xcodeproj`
	3. Expand the `JniKeys.xcodeproj` ➜ `Products` folder
	4. In the project navigator, select your project. Add 		`JniKeys.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
	5. And go the Build Settings tab. Make sure All is toggled on (instead of Basic)
	6. Look for Header Search Paths and add `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-jni-keys/ios/**` as `non-recursive`


 - Manual Link (Android) 

	**android/settings.gradle**
	
	```diff
	+ include ':react-native-jni-keys'
	+ project(':react-native-jni-keys').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-jni-keys/android')
	```
	**android/app/build.gradle**
	
	```diff
	dependencies {
		implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
	+	implementation project(':react-native-jni-keys')
	}
	```
	**MainApplication.java**
	
	```diff
	+ import com.reactnativejnikeys.JniKeysPackage;
	
	@Override
	protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
		   return Arrays.asList(
           		new MainReactPackage()
	+      		new JniKeysPackage()
	    );
	}
	```

## Native Usage

### Android
you can only read jni key into java file.
```java
import com.reactnativejnikeys.JniKeysModule;

JniKeysModule.getKeySync("key1");   //value1
```

### iOS

Read variables declared in `.env` from your Obj-C classes like:

```objective-c
// import header
#import "JniKeys.h"

// then read individual keys like:
NSString *value = [JniKeys getKeySync:@"key1"];   //value1
```

- Go to _Edit scheme..._ -> _Build_ -> _Pre-actions_, click _+_ and select _New Run Script Action_. Paste below code which will generate JNI keys on native ios side (into node_modules) Make sure to select your target under _Provide build settings from_, so `$SRCROOT` environment variables is available to the script.

```
"${SRCROOT}/../node_modules/react-native-jni-keys/jniIOS.js"
```

#### Android


you have define in `build.gradle` like:

```
apply from: project(':react-native-jni-keys').projectDir.getPath() + "/jniKeys.gradle"
```


#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

Start by creating a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "Myapp (staging)"

Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

- Expand the "Build" settings on left
- Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
- Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type:
 ```
"${SRCROOT}/../node_modules/react-native-jni-keys/jniIOS.js"
  ```
Also ensure that "Provide build settings from", just above the script, has a value selected so that PROJECT_DIR is set.
